{NES Tetris Web Clone}
% {}
{
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal: To make a web based Tetris game that mimics the behaviour and rules
of the classic NES Tetris game as closely as possible, with the ability to send
a unique URL to a friend so that they are able to play the same sequence of
pieces so you can compare your scores. The scores would be listed on the page
for that game.
\item Currently the game is in development. The game itself is playable but
there are some bugs and issues I plan to address, and scores for the game are
not saved or listed on the page. I plan to solve this by saving scores to a
database, and using PHP to generate the game page with the scores listed.
\item {\bf Skills}: TypeScript, PHP, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS\\
\end{itemize}
