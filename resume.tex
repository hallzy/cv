\begin{itemize}
\item Goal: To share memory (RDDs) across Apache Spark instances through a
unified memory manager.
\end{itemize}
}
\entry
{January 2015--\\August 2015}
{Ericsson {\normalfont Software Developer Co-op}}
{Burnaby, BC}
{
\begin{itemize}
\item Tested and developed quality of service and policy based routing software
solutions on a variety of Ericsson's routing platforms using a combination of
manual router configurations and scripts for testing.
\item Presented demos showing the functionality and progress of policy based
routing during the testing and development phases.
\end{itemize}

\begin{entrylist}

\entry
{November 2017\\}
  {Web Application {\normalfont Online Store}}
{}
{
\begin{itemize}
\item Built a web application that mimics an online store using AJAX requests
and MongoDB
\end{itemize}
}
\entry
{April 2017}
{Capstone {\normalfont IoT Based Livestock Bio-Signal Monitoring and Management System}}
{}
{
\begin{itemize}
\item Construct cattle eartags that comply with Canadian Cattle Identification
Agency (CCIA) standards which track vital information such as heart rate, body
temperature, and rumination patterns.
\item The information is stored on the tag until the time comes for the
data to be transferred wirelessly through a mesh network of cattle to a gateway
for further processing. The data is then displayed in a web application for the
end users.
\item This is designed to identify sick animals early to keep medical costs low
and prevent more livestock from getting sick.
\end{itemize}
}
\entry
{April 2014}
{Electromagnetically Tethered Robot}
{}
{
\begin{itemize}
\item Constructed a robot using one solid piece of aluminum resulting in usable
parts that we used for the remote and robot.
\item Designed, built, and programmed an autonomous robot that follows an
electromagnetic signal produced by a
solenoid on a remote that our group also built, resulting in a high grade. The
remote sends binary data through
the magnetic field that tell the robot to spin 180 degrees, move back, move
forward, and parallel park.
