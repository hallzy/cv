# About
Latest version of my CV, typesetted in Helvetica and using colors inspired by
Monokai (there is an `print` option which renders in black and white, and
reverts the header to dark on light, if printing on paper is needed).

Uses TikZ for the header, XeTeX and fontspec to use Helvetica Neue, biblatex to
print my publications and textpos for the aside.

# Features

I have added a Keywords section, which allows me to add keywords to the bottom
of my resume and will be too small to see. The text is also white so it is not
visible. The only purpose of this is to get past algorithms that companies use
that check resumes for specific words before a real person looks at it, since
the words can be found in a search of the file.

# Build

Build the pdf by just running `make`.
